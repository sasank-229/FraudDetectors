A dataset is uploaded in the repository with respect to the ML algorithm
Initially, the work flow of the Algorithm includes the following steps:
  1. Import Libraries 
  2. Labeling the Datasets and Graphing of Spam or Ham
  3. NLTK and Stopwords
  4. PortStemmer
  5. Lematization and Clean Text
  6. Common Spam or Ham words
  7. Count Vectorizer
  8. Tf-Idf Transformer and Vectorizer
  9. Train-Test Split
  10. Random Forest Classifier
  11. Gradient Boosting Classifier
  12. Final Mean Score and Output
